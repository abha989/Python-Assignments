        "Here are the key advantages of OOP:\n",
        "1. Modularity - The source code is divided into discrete, self-contained units called classes.\n",
        "2. Reusability - Classes can be reused across different parts of a program or even in other projects through inheritance.\n",
        "3. Data Encapsulation - OOP bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class,\n",
        "restricting unauthorized access.\n",
        "4. Polymorphism - Allows the same operation to behave differently on different classes.\n",
        "5. Abstraction - Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "6. Easy Maintenance and Upgrades - OOP's modular structure makes it easier to update specific parts of the system without affecting the entire codebase.\n",
        "8. Code Scalability - OOP makes it easy to build scalable applications that can grow in complexity without becoming unmanageable.\n",
        "9. Real-World Mapping - OOP models real-world entities as objects, making it intuitive for developers.\n",
        "10. Better Collaboration - OOP allows developers to work on different classes or modules simultaneously without interfering with each other's work."
