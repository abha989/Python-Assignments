        "'''In Python, functions and methods are closely related but differ in their usage and context. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Definition and Context\n",
        "Function: A function is a block of reusable code that is defined using the def keyword and can exist independently in a module or script.\n",
        "It is not tied to any object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: A method is a function that is associated with an object and typically defined within a class.\n",
        " It is called on an instance of the class and can operate on the data contained within that instance.\n",
        " How They Are Called\n",
        "Function: Called directly by its name (if in the same scope) or by importing it from a module.\n",
        "Method: Called on an object (or instance) using dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Binding\n",
        "Function: Functions are not inherently bound to any object. They take explicit arguments, including objects they may act upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: Methods are bound to the object they are called on,\n",
        "and they can access the objectâ€™s attributes and other methods through self (or cls for class methods).\n",

        "4. Types\n",
        "Methods can be further categorized:\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Method: Operates on an instance of the class and has access to instance attributes (self).\n",
        "Class Method: Operates on the class itself and is defined using the @classmethod decorator. It takes cls as the first parameter.\n",

        "4. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)\n",
        "Definition: Use the lambda keyword for short, single-expression functions.\n",
        "Call: Assign to a variable or use directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Nested Functions\n",
        "Definition: Define a function inside another function. Useful for encapsulating logic or creating closures.\n",
        "Call: Call the inner function through the outer function.\n",
