        "\n",
        "1. Definition and Context\n",
        "Function: A function is a block of reusable code that is defined using the def keyword and can exist independently in a module or script.\n",
        "It is not tied to any object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: A method is a function that is associated with an object and typically defined within a class.\n",
        " It is called on an instance of the class and can operate on the data contained within that instance.\n",
        " How They Are Called\n",
        "Function: Called directly by its name (if in the same scope) or by importing it from a module.\n",
        "Method: Called on an object (or instance) using dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Binding\n",
        "Function: Functions are not inherently bound to any object. They take explicit arguments, including objects they may act upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: Methods are bound to the object they are called on,\n",
        "and they can access the object’s attributes and other methods through self (or cls for class methods).\n",

        "4. Types\n",
        "Methods can be further categorized:\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Method: Operates on an instance of the class and has access to instance attributes (self).\n",
        "Class Method: Operates on the class itself and is defined using the @classmethod decorator. It takes cls as the first parameter.\n",

        "4. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)\n",
        "Definition: Use the lambda keyword for short, single-expression functions.\n",
        "Call: Assign to a variable or use directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Nested Functions\n",
        "Definition: Define a function inside another function. Useful for encapsulating logic or creating closures.\n",
        "Call: Call the inner function through the outer function.\n",
